# shipcopter
a pygame helicopter sidescroller

## Requirements
This game will contain different levels on different worlds which have different gravities, landscapes, and atmospheric thicknesses. The screen scrolls left-to-right and the player loses a life if their ship touches any edge or any part of the landscape that does not have a landing pad/zone. There is a fuel guage the player has to keep track of as well. There are fuel landing pads that allow the player to land while the screen still moves. Landing zones are level success conditions. The screen can also occasionally move downward and upward depending on the landscape.

## Level Ideas
* Asteroid field with microgravity
* Earth-like planet
* Moon with no atmosphere
* Somewhere with tunnels
